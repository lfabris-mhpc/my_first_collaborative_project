This is an extremely interesting text.
This is the result to he work of AStudent 
and BStudent.

Meanwhile BStudent cloned the master branch on his local machine 
and created a new branch called b_modification. 
He then proceeded to make modifications to the second paragraph of text.
He tried to explain exactly what he did and he did so in a verbose
and, frankly, boring fashion.

AStudent suddenly realises that there is a 
very nice text, that copes very nicely with 
what BStudent is about to write. This is why 
he is creating a new branch and writing 
his text here. 
*PLACE HOLDER: ASTUDENT'S TEXT*

Before merging the two branches, AStudent
writes a very nice conclusion for the document
and commits it.
*PLACE HOLDER: (ASTUDENT or BSTUDENT)'S TEXT*
